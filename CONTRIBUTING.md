Changeset comments are the best way to discuss specific edits. Our team monitors changeset comments closely and will respond quickly.

If you have a more general suggestion, question or concern about the Telenav mapping team's activities, you can add an issue right here. Our team monitors this repo closely and will usually get back to you within a day. 

Every mapping project we start has its own [issue](https://github.com/TelenavMapping/mapping-projects/issues). Please have a look at the list and see if your comment is specific to one of the projects listed there. If so, just add a comment to that project.

If you don't see a mapping project your question, suggestion or concern relates to, feel free to open a new issue. It helps a lot if you give it a meaningful title and description.

You can find a list of all of our team members [here](https://github.com/TelenavMapping/mapping-projects/wiki/Team) if you want to get in touch with one of us individually. All our team members' OSM usernames end in `_telenav`.
